# openScience
describe tips and tricks to make a scientific production open reproducible and collaborative

we build and exploit a Virtual Research Environement (VRE) via [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/)

Inspired by VRE4EIC

The VRE4EIC project addresses key data and software challenges in supporting multidisciplinary data driven sciences. These include:
1) understanding complex user requirements across domains by closely involving committed user communities;
2) improving the quality of VRE user experience by providing user centred, secure, privacy compliant, sustainable environments for accessing data, composing workflows and tracking data publications;
3) increasing VRE usage in multidisciplinary research domains by abstracting and reusing building blocks and workflows from existing VRE initiatives;
4) improving the interoperability of heterogeneous discovery, contextual and detailed metadata across all layers of the VRE; and
5) promoting the exploitation of VRE4EIC solutions to different research communities and commercially.
