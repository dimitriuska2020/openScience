describe tips and tricks to make a scientific production open reproducible and collaborative

"When all researchers are aware of Open Science, and are trained, supported and guided at all career stages to practice Open Science, the potential is there to fundamentally change the way research is performed and disseminated, fostering a scientific ecosystem in which research gains increased visibility, is shared more efficiently, and is performed with enhanced research integrity." Open Science Skills Working Group Report (2017)





we build and exploit a Virtual Research Environement (VRE) via [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/)

Inspired by VRE4EIC

The VRE4EIC project addresses key data and software challenges in supporting multidisciplinary data driven sciences. These include:
1) understanding complex user requirements across domains by closely involving committed user communities;
2) improving the quality of VRE user experience by providing user centred, secure, privacy compliant, sustainable environments for accessing data, composing workflows and tracking data publications;
3) increasing VRE usage in multidisciplinary research domains by abstracting and reusing building blocks and workflows from existing VRE initiatives;
4) improving the interoperability of heterogeneous discovery, contextual and detailed metadata across all layers of the VRE; and
5) promoting the exploitation of VRE4EIC solutions to different research communities and commercially.
